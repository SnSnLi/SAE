# SAE

We are sorry that we can't publish all the specific code for the time being, and we will gradually open source all the code after this article is accepted. Shown here is the code that corresponds to the implementation of each chapter (the content is the same as the project, but separated for easy access).

## Structure
- `EVA.py`: Main model implementation
- `ResNet50WithMECS`: ResNet50 backbone with MECS module
- `spline_interpolate`: Spline interpolation functions
- `data_pro`: Data processing utilities
- `BFM`: Feature enhancement module
